[The STAR Method](https://dardenreviews.github.io/STAR_method.pdf)

>Think of answering interview questions as storytelling, not rambling, loose storytelling, but tight, compelling storytelling. How do you transform your interview stories from rambling to concise and powerful? Use the STAR method when you prepare for your interviews.

>Interviewing is a skill in and of itself. Just as you review concepts and projects in your preparation, you MUST spend time preparing answers for common questions if you want to be a showstopper. The STAR method is just a way to organize your thoughts step-by-step, so don't worry about perfecting your written story. These are your preparation notes, so you won't be reading from or publishing these. Spend the majority of your time getting comfortable telling your stories in a natural yet engaging manner.
