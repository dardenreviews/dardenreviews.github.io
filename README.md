# Welcome to Darden's Reviews

This site contains reviews I have created and resources I have gathered to support you on your journey through Codeup's Data Science program and beyond. 

I highly suggest making your own site as a portfolio that shows off your own work throughout the program. It would be a great link to share on your LinkedIn and drop on your resume for potential employers!
