# Welcome to Darden's Reviews

This site contains reviews I have created and resources I have gathered to support you on your journey through Codeup's Data Science program and beyond. 

I highly suggest making your own site as a portfolio that shows off your own work throughout the program. It would be a great link to share on your LinkedIn and drop on your resume for potential employers!

[Github Page Tutorial](https://dardenreviews.github.io/create_your_portfolio.pdf)

This tutorial will go live Tuesday for my Github Page Lunch 'n' Learn!!

>Want to make your own site as a personal portfolio? Check out this How-To infographic I created. This will get your site up and running in less than half an hour! When you're ready to make your markdown files beautiful, check out the tutorial below.

[Stats Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/stats_review/stats_review)

>This notebook covers Probability Distributions and Hypothesis Testing. I tried to make the concepts approachable and included lots of helpful examples and code snippets.

[Classification Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/)

Coming Soon!

>This notebook covers the Classification data science pipeline from Acquire through Evaluate. Again, I hope that the concepts are approachable, and I've included plenty of helpful code snippets for each stage of the pipeline.

[Linear Regression Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/)

Coming Soon!

>This notebook covers the Linear Regression data science pipeline from Acquire through Evaluate. Again, I hope that the concepts are approachable, and I've included plenty of helpful code snippets for each stage of the pipeline.
