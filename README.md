# Welcome to Darden's Reviews

This site contains reviews I have created and resources I have gathered to support you on your journey through Codeup's Data Science program and beyond. 

I highly suggest making your own site as a portfolio that shows off your own work throughout the program. It would be a great link to share on your LinkedIn and drop on your resume for potential employers!

## Data Science Tools

SQL Review Notebooks

>These notebook introduce SQL as a tool to interrogate databases and acquire data for use with python libraries like numpy and pandas. They will cover everything from RDBMS terms and structure to subqueries that involve joining and filtering data from multiple tables.

- [SQL Intro Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/sql_intro)

>This notebook starts out with an important overview of fundamentals and goes through using `GROUP BY` clauses.

- [SQL Joins and Subqueries Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/sql_tables_and_joins)

>This notebook starts out with an overview of table relationships and goes through explanation and examples of using the `JOIN` clause and subqueries.

- [SQL Case and Temporary Tables Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/sql_extras)

>This notebooks dives into the `CASE` statement and working with temporary tables.

Python Review Notebooks

>These notebooks explore python basics and move into more complicated concepts like using list comprehensions instead of loops and creating your own functions.

- [Python Data Types and Basic Functionality](https://dardenreviews.github.io/python_dt_review_notebook)

>This notebook is a work in progress but will cover Python data types and objects along with their functionality.

Pandas Review Notebooks

>These notebooks introduce the pandas library from Series objects to DataFrame objects including their common attributes, methods, and chaining techniques.

[Pandas Series Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/pandas_series_review/pandas_series_review)

>This notebook covers creating, indexing, and using methods and attributes with the pandas Series object.

- [Pandas Series Exercises](https://dardenreviews.github.io/pandas_series_walkthrough/pandas_series_walkthrough)

>Check out lots of great examples of code in action with the pandas Series.

[Pandas DataFrame Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/pandas_dataframes_review)

>This notebook covers creating, indexing, aggregating, joining, manipulating, sorting, reshaping, and styling pandas DataFrames.

- [Pandas DataFrames Exercises](https://dardenreviews.github.io/dataframes_exercise_walkthrough/dataframes_exercise_walkthrough)

>More code in action, but this time with DataFrames.

- [Pandas Advanced DataFrames Exercises](https://dardenreviews.github.io/advanced_dataframes_walkthrough/advanced_dataframes_walkthrough)

>Advanced DataFrames exercise walkthrough solutions.

[Stats Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/stats_review/stats_review)

>This notebook covers Probability Distributions and Hypothesis Testing. I tried to make the concepts approachable and included lots of helpful examples and code snippets.

[REST API Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/api_review)

>This notebook is a very crash course in using a REST API to acquire data. I included foundational terminology I encountered in my own reading and research and some simple code examples. There are also lots of links to further reading and free APIs for more practice.

## Machine Learning

[Classification Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/classification_review/classification_review)

>This notebook covers the Classification data science pipeline from Acquire through Evaluate. Again, I hope that the concepts are approachable, and I've included plenty of helpful code snippets for each stage of the pipeline. This is my most ambitious review notebook yet!

- [Classification Acquire Exercises](https://dardenreviews.github.io/classification_acquire/classification_acquire)

>This notebook covers reading data into DataFrames using a variety of methods, a look at writing functions with data caching options, and creating an acquire module for future use.

- [Classification Prepare Exercises](https://dardenreviews.github.io/classification_prepare)

>This notebook covers preparing data by encoding with `pd.get_dummies()`, by imputing using `SimpleImputer`, by splitting using `train_test_split`, and creating a prepare module for future use.

[Linear Regression Review Notebook](https://dardenreviews.github.io/regression_review)

>This notebook covers the Linear Regression data science pipeline from Acquire through Evaluate. Again, I hope that the concepts are approachable through expanded notes, and I've included plenty of helpful code snippets for each stage of the pipeline. There are lots of great resources linked for future study, as well.
